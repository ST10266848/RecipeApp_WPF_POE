# How to Install, Run and Use My Recipe App:

## Prerequisties:
#### **Before installing my Recipe App, please ensure that you have Visual Studio Community, C# 9 and .NET 6+ already installed on your machine**

## How To Install My Recipe App
- On the code page of my github repo, click on the Part2 tag on the releases tab.
- Once on the release page, you will see the latest release of my app which is Part 2.
- Now, click on the source code link (the zip link is recommend) and your browser's download popup will appear,
- which you must accept and save the file.
- Once downloaded, the file should appear in your downloads folder which you must navigate to.
- Once there, right click the file and select extract all to a desired local location.
- Once extracted, open the folder that is created and you should see 2 things:
- This README file and a folder named "RecipeApp_POE"
- The latter contains my application and every file you need to run it.
- Now, all you have to do click on the RecipeApp_POE.sln file, and Visual Studio should automaically open for you.
- Great! You have successfully installed my Recipe App! Now, it's time to tell you how to operate it! ^^

## How To Run And Use My Recipe App:
- Okay, you made it to seeing my recipe app in Visual Studio but now what should you do?
- Why not click on green play button next to the name of my app, RecipeApp_POE on the top bar?
- Once you cick on the green play button, the program will run!
- Here, you will be greated by fancy yet warm welcome screen and main menu! ^^
- The main menu presents you with a wealth of options to choose from
- ,though you are recommended to start with adding a recipe for doing anything else.
  
### But first, let's give you a little run down of each option:
  1. Add Recipie - allows you to add a recipe from all of it's ingredients to all of it's steps!
  2. Display Recipie - allows you to display the recipe that you have added!
  3. Scale Recipe - allows you scale the ingredients and their quantities if you wish to make half a cake or 2 cakes instead of 1 or even 3 cakes for example
  4. Revert Recipe - Scaled your recipe by accident? or perhaps you just wanna return to the original ingredient quantities or recipe? Then this will be your friend!
  5. Clear Recipie - Would you perhaps like to add another recipe? Then this option will allow you to do just that by letting you clear all the details of the current recipe from the system
  6. Close Application - Finished using our app for the day? Then feel free to close the application but remember your recipe data will be lost!

#### A little headsup:
** This app has it moved on from console and now has a WPF GUI Frontend! **

** Now let's look at each of the above options in greater detail by walking you through each of them **
#### Add Recipe:
- Move your cursor to the 'Add Recipe' button and right-click on it
- You will then be prompted with a nice screen with places such as textboxes
- for the user to enter details for each recipe.
- All you have to do is move your cursor to one of the textboxes,
- preferably one by Recipe Name and again, simply just right click on it.
- Now you will be able to enter details about the recipe such
- as well the name of each Recipe, the name of each ingredient, the quantity of each incredient,
- the unit of measure of each ingredient quantity, the number of calories of each ingredient as well as
- the description of each step.
- To add an ingredient, fill in all necessary Ingredient details in section '2. Add Ingredients'
- and then with your cursor, right-click or click on the 'Add ingredient' button.
- Now, follow the same procedure as you did for Ingredients but for step descriptions.
- Add as much ingredients or steps as you desire or require.
- The step description should be used for explaining what to do for that particular recipe step.
- Once all details have been added successfully, you will be given feedback and you will be returned to the main menu.
- And if you wish to add another recipe, you are free to do so as the app has been improved to handle multiple recipes!

#### Display Recipe:
- After adding your very first recipe, you should now display your saved recipe by selecting the "View Recipe" button from the main menu.
- You will be presented with a list of recipes that you have added and that were stored on the system.
- All you have to do is correctly enter the name of recipe you would like to view.
- Do this by selecting the textbox and entering the name into the textbox.
- Your recipe will then be displayed to you in a beautiful and unique way - which I could go on and on about but it is a little something for you to enjoy!
- You will also be allowed to return to the main menu after you're done

#### Scale Recipe:
- Select the 'Scale Recipe' button from the main menu to do precisely that.
- You will be presented with a list of recipes that you have added and that were stored on the system.
- You presented with another new window.
- All you have to do is correctly enter the name of the recipe you would like to scale.
- After you do that, you will be able to select an option from the list of 3 factors:
- 0.5 which halves the quantities of the ingredients
- 2 which doubles the ingredient quantites
- 3 which triples the ingredient quantites
- Also, remember, even if you do not choose a scale factor, the first option is always
- automatically checked. You can click on another option by clicking on the little white circle
- next to the option
- If you choose the 2nd option for example which is '2',
- your recipe's ingredient quantities will be doubled.
- So if you had a recipe for one cake but wanted to make 2 cakes instead,
- this function would be perfect for you.
- The scaled recipe with all its details including the scaled quantities
- will be displayed to you.
- You are again returned back to the main menu afterwards


#### Reset Recipe:
- If you want to reset the recipe and the ingredient quantities back to the original quantities,
- , 
- You will be presented with a list of recipes that you have added and that were stored on the system.
- All you have to do is correctly enter the name of recipe you would like to reset the quantities for.
- The recipe's ingredient quantities will be resetted to normal and the original recipe will be displayed to you,
- before you are returned to the main menu.

#### Clear Recipe:
- If you would like to delete a Recipe, please click on the button called "Clear Recipe".
- You will be presented with a list of recipes that you have added and that were stored on the system.
- All you have to do is correctly enter the name of recipe you would like to delete.
- It will ask you to confirm whether you actually wish to proceed with clearing all current recipe data.
- Enter Yes to continue or No! to return to main menu without deleting anything.
- If you continue, all current recipe data will be deleted forever,
- and you will be able to add a new one!

#### Close App:
- If you are done using our app for the day or for the time being,
- then you can exit the application by selecting the 'Close App' option by clicking its button.
- Though remember that all stored data up until that point will automatically be cleared.
- Don't worry though as you will confirm whether you actually want to exit or not.
- Enter Yes to continue with exiting the app or No! to cancel and not exit the app (you will be returned to the main menu)
- If you enter 'Yes', then you will exit the app and any data you stored will be deleted forever.
- If you enter 'No!', you will be taken back to the main menu where you can choose another option.
